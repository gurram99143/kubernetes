Service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for making service to service communication safe, fast, reliable and configurable.
service mesh allows you to separate the business logic of the application from observability, and network and security policies. It allows you to connect, secure, and monitor your microservices.

Connect: Service Mesh enables services to discover and talk to each other. It enables intelligent routing to control the flow of traffic and API calls between services/endpoints. These also enable advanced deployment strategies such as blue/green, canaries or rolling upgrades, and more.
Secure: Service Mesh allows you secure communication between services. It can enforce policies to allow or deny communication. E.g. you can configure a policy to deny access to production services from a client service running in the development environment.
Monitor: Service Mesh enables observability of your distributed microservices system. Service Mesh often integrates out-of-the-box with monitoring and tracing tools (such as Prometheus and Jaeger in the case of Kubernetes) to allow you to discover and visualize dependencies between services, traffic flow, API latencies, and tracing.
